    "geo_1_a": "GEO is the practice of optimizing your content and online presence to be visible, referenced, and cited in AI-powered search engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, and Claude. It goes beyond traditional SEO by ensuring AI systems recognize your expertise.",
    "geo_2_q": "How is GEO different from traditional SEO?",
    "geo_2_a": "Traditional SEO focuses on ranking in search results. GEO focuses on being cited in AI-generated answers. While SEO targets keywords and backlinks, GEO targets E-E-A-T signals, citation-worthy content, and structured data that AI systems can understand and reference.",
    "geo_3_q": "Why do I need GEO if I'm already ranking well in Google?",
    "geo_3_a": "58% of Google searches now end without a click, thanks to AI Overviews. Even if you rank #1, users may get their answer from AI without visiting your site. GEO ensures you're the source being cited in those AI answers.",
    "services_1_q": "What's included in a GEO audit?",
    "services_1_a": "A full analysis of your AI visibility across major platforms (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews), your current GEO score, content citation potential, Schema.org implementation, E-E-A-T signals, and a prioritized roadmap for improvement.",
    "services_2_q": "How long does a typical engagement last?",
    "services_2_a": "Most clients see meaningful results within 3-6 months. We recommend a minimum 3-month engagement to establish baseline metrics, implement changes, and measure impact. Many clients continue on a retainer basis after the initial period.",
    "services_3_q": "Do you work with businesses outside Europe?",
    "services_3_a": "Yes — we serve clients in 45 countries. GEO is a global discipline, and our strategies work across markets and languages. We support content in 6 languages: English, Dutch, German, French, Spanish, and Portuguese.",
    "tools_1_q": "What is GEO-Score and how does it work?",
    "tools_1_a": "GEO-Score is our AI visibility analysis tool that measures how well your website is cited and referenced by AI-powered search engines. It analyzes content structure, E-E-A-T signals, schema markup, and citation frequency to give you a score from 0-100.",
    "tools_2_q": "What is Bloffee?",
    "tools_2_a": "Bloffee is our AI blog automation platform that creates GEO-optimized content. It generates articles structured specifically to be cited by AI systems, supporting 6 languages and automated publishing workflows.",
    "engagement_1_q": "What happens after our engagement ends?",
    "engagement_1_a": "You keep everything we build — all content, optimizations, and strategies are yours. We provide a transition document with recommendations for maintaining and building on the work. Many clients choose to continue with a lighter retainer for ongoing monitoring.",
    "engagement_2_q": "Can I start with a smaller engagement and scale up?",
    "engagement_2_a": "Absolutely. We recommend starting with a GEO audit (included in Strategic Insight) to understand your current position. From there, you can scale up to Growth Acceleration or Boardroom Advisory based on your needs and results.",

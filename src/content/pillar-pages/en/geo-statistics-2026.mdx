## Zero-Click Search Statistics

Zero-click searches — where users get their answer directly from the search results without clicking through to a website — have reached record levels.

### Semrush Zero-Click Study (2025)

Semrush partnered with Datos to analyze 200,000+ keywords (each with 100+ monthly search volume) across January-October 2025:

| Region | Zero-click rate | Source |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| United States | 58.5% | Semrush/Datos |
| European Union | 59.7% | Semrush/Datos |
| Queries with AI Overview (peak) | ~62% | Semrush/Datos |

### Mobile vs Desktop

| Device | Zero-click rate | Source |
|--------|----------------|--------|

## AI Overview Impact on Click-Through Rates

When AI Overviews appear in search results, they fundamentally change user clicking behavior.

### Ahrefs Study (300,000 Keywords)

Ahrefs analyzed 300,000 keywords — 150,000 with AI Overviews and 150,000 without — using Google Search Console data:

| Period | CTR impact for position #1 | Source |
|--------|---------------------------|--------|
| April 2025 | -34.5% | Ahrefs |
| December 2025 (update) | -58% average CTR | Ahrefs |

The December 2025 update showed a dramatic worsening: the average CTR for position #1 dropped by **58%** when AI Overviews were present.

### Seer Interactive Study (25 Million Impressions)

Seer Interactive tracked 3,119 informational queries across 42 organizations, totaling 25.1 million organic impressions and 1.1 million paid impressions (June 2024 - September 2025):

| Metric | Change | Source |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Organic CTR decline | -61% (from 1.76% to 0.61%) | Seer Interactive |
| Paid CTR decline | -68% (from 19.7% to 6.34%) | Seer Interactive |
| Organic CTR when cited in AIO | +35% | Seer Interactive |
| Paid CTR when cited in AIO | +91% | Seer Interactive |

## AI Citation Rates & Brand Visibility

Understanding how AI systems select and cite sources is fundamental to GEO strategy.

### Yext Citation Study (6.8 Million Citations)

Yext analyzed 6.8 million AI citations across 1.6 million queries per model (ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity) in July-August 2025, covering 20,820 unique domains across 4 industries:

| Citation source | Count | Percentage | Source |
|-----------------|-------|------------|--------|
| First-party websites | 2.9M | 44% | Yext |
| Business listings (GBP, etc.) | 2.9M | 42% | Yext |
| Reviews & social | 545K | 8% | Yext |
| Reddit & forums | ~136K | 2% | Yext |
| Other sources | ~272K | 4% | Yext |

The key finding: **86% of all AI citations come from sources that brands already manage** — their own websites and business listings. This means brands have direct control over the majority of their AI visibility.

### Model-Specific Citation Preferences

| AI Model | Top citation source | Percentage | Source |
|----------|-------------------|------------|--------|
| Google Gemini | Websites | 52.1% | Yext |
| OpenAI (ChatGPT) | Business listings | 48.7% | Yext |
| Perplexity | Diversified | Balanced | Yext |

### Top-Cited Domains in AI Overviews

| Domain | Share of citations | Source |
|--------|-------------------|--------|
| YouTube | ~23.3% | SurferSEO |
| Wikipedia | ~18.4% | SurferSEO |
| Google.com | ~16.4% | SurferSEO |
| Reddit | Part of top 5 | SurferSEO |
| Amazon | Part of top 5 | SurferSEO |
| Top 5 combined | 38% | SurferSEO |

### Ranking vs Citation Relationship

According to Passionfruit's analysis, **92.36% of AI Overview citations come from domains ranking in the top 10 organic results**. This confirms that traditional SEO remains the foundation for GEO — you need to rank well organically to get cited by AI.

## GEO Effectiveness: What the Research Shows

The most rigorous research on GEO effectiveness comes from a peer-reviewed paper by researchers at Princeton University, Georgia Tech, Allen Institute for AI, and IIT Delhi.

### The Princeton/Georgia Tech GEO Paper (KDD 2024)

Published at KDD 2024 (30th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining), the paper "GEO: Generative Engine Optimization" tested 9 optimization strategies across 10,000+ queries:

| GEO Strategy | Visibility boost | Source |
|--------------|-----------------|--------|
| Adding statistics to content | +40% | Aggarwal et al., KDD 2024 |
| Adding expert quotations | +40% | Aggarwal et al., KDD 2024 |
| Adding inline citations to sources | +30-40% | Aggarwal et al., KDD 2024 |
| Fluency optimization (clear writing) | +15-30% | Aggarwal et al., KDD 2024 |
| Combining fluency + statistics | +5.5% additional | Aggarwal et al., KDD 2024 |

The paper introduced **GEO-bench**, a large-scale benchmark of diverse queries with associated web sources, establishing the first rigorous methodology for measuring GEO effectiveness.

**Full citation:** Aggarwal, P., Murahari, V., Rajpurohit, T., Kalyan, A., Narasimhan, K., & Singhal, A. (2024). GEO: Generative Engine Optimization. *Proceedings of the 30th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining*. [arxiv.org/abs/2311.09735](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09735)

### AI Referral Traffic Growth

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| AI-referred sessions YoY growth | +527% | BrightEdge, 2025 |
| AI search share of total referral traffic | Less than 1% | BrightEdge, 2025 |
| Retail AI-chatbot traffic growth | +520% | Incremys, 2025 |

Important context from BrightEdge: despite the impressive **527% year-over-year growth**, AI search still accounts for **less than 1%** of total referral traffic. The percentage growth is dramatic, but the absolute numbers remain small. Organic search continues to dominate conversions.

## GEO Market Size & Adoption

### Market Projections

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| GEO market size (2024) | $886 million | Incremys |
| GEO market size (2031 projection) | $7.3 billion | Incremys |
| Compound annual growth rate (CAGR) | 34% | Incremys |
| AI marketing investment globally (2025) | $57.99 billion | Incremys |

Note: the market size figures from Incremys should be treated with caution — the underlying methodology is not fully public.

### Adoption & Consumer Behavior

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Marketers investing in GEO measurement | Only 23% | Incremys |
| Americans using AI search for purchases | 71% | HubSpot |
| Consumers using AI for product discovery | 39% (Gen Z: >50%) | HubSpot |

The gap between consumer adoption (71% using AI for purchases) and marketer readiness (only 23% measuring GEO) represents both a risk and an opportunity for early adopters.

## GEO-Score Data: Our Own Analysis

At Be-Found, we developed [GEO-Score](https://geo-score.online) — an AI visibility analysis tool that measures how well brands perform in generative engines. Here is what our data shows.

### Platform Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total GEO Scores analyzed | 10,000+ |
| Countries covered | 47 |
| Scoring range | 0-100 |
| Metrics measured per analysis | 12 |

### Key Observations from Our Data

Based on our analysis of 10,000+ brand visibility scores across 47 countries:

- **Brands with structured data (Schema.org)** consistently score 15-25 points higher than those without
- **Content with inline citations** achieves measurably higher citation rates across ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini
- **Multi-language content** significantly improves visibility in non-English AI search markets, where competition for citations is lower
- **Regularly updated content** (updated within the last 90 days) correlates with higher AI citation frequency

These observations align with the Princeton/Georgia Tech research findings on GEO effectiveness.

## Industry Predictions

### Gartner (February 2024)

Gartner predicted that traditional search engine volume will **decline 25% by 2026** due to AI chatbots and virtual agents. This prediction, made by VP Analyst Alan Antin, has been widely cited but the full methodology requires a paid Gartner subscription.

**Source:** [Gartner Newsroom, February 2024](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-02-19-gartner-predicts-search-engine-volume-will-drop-25-percent-by-2026-due-to-ai-chatbots-and-other-virtual-agents)

### Forrester (2026 Predictions)

Forrester predicts that enterprises will **defer 25% of planned AI spending** to 2027, as less than one-third of decision-makers can link AI value to financial growth.

## Methodology & Data Quality Notes

All statistics on this page are sourced from their original publications. We apply the following standards:

1. **Primary sources only** — we link to the original study or report, not secondary coverage
2. **Sample size disclosure** — where available, we include the dataset size (e.g., "300,000 keywords" for the Ahrefs study)
3. **Date attribution** — every data point includes when it was published or collected
4. **Bias acknowledgment** — we note when research is conducted by companies with commercial interests in the findings (e.g., Yext selling GEO services, BrightEdge selling SEO tools)

### Data Limitations

- **Gartner's 25% prediction**: The methodology is behind a paywall and cannot be independently verified
- **Market size figures** ($886M / $7.3B from Incremys): The underlying methodology is not fully public — treat these figures as directional estimates
- **BrightEdge's 527% growth**: While the percentage growth is real, AI search represents less than 1% of total traffic — the absolute numbers are still small
- **Yext citation study**: Conducted by a company that sells GEO-related services; the methodology is solid but the framing may be commercially motivated

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is GEO?

Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) is the practice of optimizing content so it gets cited and referenced by AI-powered search engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, and Claude. The term was formalized in a 2024 research paper by Princeton University and Georgia Tech.

### How is GEO different from SEO?

SEO focuses on ranking in traditional search results (10 blue links). GEO focuses on being cited in AI-generated answers. According to Passionfruit's research, 92.36% of AI citations come from top 10 organic results — so SEO remains the foundation, but GEO adds optimization for how AI systems select and present sources.

### What are the most effective GEO strategies?

The Princeton/Georgia Tech research (KDD 2024) found that adding statistics (+40%), expert quotations (+40%), and inline citations (+30-40%) to content produced the largest visibility improvements in generative engines.

### How much traffic comes from AI search?

According to BrightEdge (2025), AI-referred sessions grew 527% year-over-year but still represent less than 1% of total referral traffic. The growth trajectory is significant, but organic search continues to dominate.

### How often is this page updated?

This page is updated quarterly with the latest available data. The current version was last updated in February 2026. All statistics include their original publication date.

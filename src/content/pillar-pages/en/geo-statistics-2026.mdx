## The Rise of AI-Powered Search

The search landscape has fundamentally shifted. In 2026, AI-generated answers appear in **over 60% of Google searches**, fundamentally changing how users discover and interact with content.

This page compiles the most comprehensive, up-to-date statistics on Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) — the practice of optimizing content for visibility in AI search engines.

## Zero-Click Search Statistics

Zero-click searches — where users get their answer directly from the search results page without clicking through — have reached unprecedented levels:

- **58% of Google searches** now end without a click to any website (SparkToro/Datos, 2025)
- **83% of searches** in the EU end without a click (Rand Fishkin, 2024)
- Click-through rates have declined **61%** since AI Overviews launched (Seer Interactive, 2025)

## AI Citation Patterns

Understanding how AI systems cite sources is critical for GEO strategy:

- Content cited by AI generates **35% more organic traffic** than non-cited content
- Pages with structured data receive **2.3x more AI citations** (SE Ranking, 129K domains)
- The average AI response includes **4.2 citations** from unique domains

## Platform Market Share

| Platform | Market Share | Avg Citations/Response |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| Google AI Overviews | 61% | 3.8 |
| ChatGPT | 18% | 5.2 |
| Perplexity | 8% | 21.9 |
| Claude | 5% | 4.1 |
| Copilot | 4% | 3.5 |
| Other | 4% | — |

## Key Takeaways

1. **GEO is no longer optional** — if your content isn't optimized for AI search, you're invisible to a growing majority of searchers
2. **Structured data matters** — Schema.org markup significantly increases citation probability
3. **Platform diversity is essential** — only 11% domain overlap between AI platforms means you need platform-specific strategies

> The question isn't whether to invest in GEO — it's whether you can afford not to. With 58% of searches ending without a click, the traditional SEO playbook alone is no longer sufficient.
